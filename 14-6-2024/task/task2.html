        <p>Quaid Azam was a great barrister and leader. He started his political career by joining the Indian National Congress in 1905. Initially, he was the big supporter of Hindu Muslim unity and was working for the independence of the Subcontinent from British rulers. When he observed the Hindus, he realised they were against the Muslims. He left the Congress and joined the All-India Muslim League. He proposed the Two-Nation theory and demanded a separate homeland for Muslims. After many struggles and hardships, finally, we got a different land on 14th August 1947. He was appointed as the first Governor-General of Pakistan and president of the first constituent assembly. In the short time of his rule, he performed extraordinary tasks. He launched civil services, made Karachi the first capital, organized the all-government institutions. He was a great leader; he was suffering from tuberculosis, but still, he was working for us. He died on 11th September 1948, and indeed it was a massive loss for us.</p>
